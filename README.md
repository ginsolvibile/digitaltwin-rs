# digitaltwin-rs
An didactic Open Source library to create and run Digital Twins. This is mostly a toy project to play with Rust macros and self-made actor models.

If you are looking for production-ready frameworks, consider looking at:

* [Actix](https://actix.rs/) or [ractor](https://github.com/slawlor/ractor) for a complete Actor Model library Rust
* [Eclipse BaSyx](https://eclipse.dev/basyx) for a comprehensive Digital Twin framework (beware: Java code ahead :))

## Project structure
- `digitaltwin-core` for core traits and types
- `digitaltwin-macros` for procedural macros
- `digitaltwin` main crate
